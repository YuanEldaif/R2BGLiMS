\usage{
JAMMR(
  bx,
  sx,
  by,
  sy,
  N1,
  eafs = NULL,
  G.matrix = NULL,
  trait.var = NULL,
  iter = 1e+06,
  w = NULL,
  n.grid = 26,
  grid.limits = NULL,
  initial.model = rep(1, length(bx)),

}
\arguments{
\item{bx}{Univariate effect estimates between each genetic variant and the risk factor.}

\item{sx}{Standard errors for the varant-risk factor genetic effects.}

\item{by}{Univariate effect estimates between each genetic variant and the outcome.}

\item{sy}{Standard errors for the variant-outcome genetic effects.}

\item{N1}{Sample size of the study from which the bx effects were obtained.}

\item{eafs}{A vector of effect allele frequencies of length same as bx.
Must be provided if genetic variants are assumed to be independent.}

\item{G.matrix}{A reference matrix for the genetic variants used in the analysis.
If present, will override eafs and force JAM-MR to model genetic variants as 
correlated. If absent, JAM-MR will assume that genetic variants are independent. 
One of eafs ad G.matrix must be specified. Note: the algorithm takes longer to
run with coorrelated instruments, therefore when genetic variants are truly  
independent it is better to specify eafs and not G.matrix.}

\item{trait.var}{An estimate of the variance in risk factor measurements. Can be 
obtained from the G-X GWAS and will be equal to 1 if the GWAS estimates are reported
based on standardized data. If not provided, it is internally estimated by JAM-MR.}

\item{iter}{The number of reversible-jump MCMC iterations to perform.}

\item{w}{Tuning parameter(s) for pleiotropy penalization. If scalar, a single
JAM-MR implementation will be run. If vector, one implementation will be run 
for each value and the minimum-causal-standard-error run will be selected. 
Values should typically be multiples of N1. Larger values encourage stronger 
penalization and smaller models.}

\item{n.grid}{If w is not specified, it is estimated by a grid search; n.grid is 
the number of grid-points to visit during the grid search. Defaults to 26. 
Redundant if w is specified.}

\item{grid.limits}{Lower and upper limits for the w values to consider during the 
grid search. The algorithm will create a grid of size n.grid by logarithmic
interpolation between the limits, plus the value w = 0. The default is a grid  
search between w = 0.01 N1 and w = 100 N1. Redundant if w is specified.}

\item{initial.model}{The model to be used in the first iteration of the stochastic 
search. By default the algorithm starts from a model with all variants included. 
It is recommended to change this to a smaller model when running applications with 
large numbers of genetic variants and correlated data.}

\item{n.models}{The (maximum) number of highest posterior probability models to be 
reported by JAM-MR. If set to zero, no models will be reported.}

\item{mretn}{Logical. If TRUE, the algorithm will fit a multiplicative random-effects
truncated normal model in order to compute model-specific standard errors when 
averaging across models. If FALSE, random-effects IVW estimates will be used instead.  
Currently this is only implemented for independent genetic variants; with correlated 
variants the algorithm will always use IVW as model-specific estimates.}

\item{jam.model.priors}{Prior parameters for JAM's beta-binomial model space prior.}

\item{loss.function}{The loss function to use. Weighted if "steve", unweighted if "variance".}

\item{jam.seed}{The seed to use for initializing the RJMCMC algorithm, if any. If 
a grid search for w is implemented, the implementations for different grid points  
will be seeded using the values jam.seed, jam.seed + 1, jam.seed + 2, ...}
}
\value{
A list with the following arguments:
\itemize{
  \item causal - Estimated causal effect.
  \item se - Causal standard error.
  \item model.matrix - If n.models > 0, a matrix containing the highest posterior
  probability models visited by JAM-MR during the variable selection procedure. See
  the function TopModels for more details.
  \item snp.probs - Posterior inclusion probabilities for each genetic variant.
  \item w - The value of the tuning parameter selected.
}
In addition, if a grid search for w is implemented:
\itemize{
  \item all.causal - Causal effect estimates for each w value.
  \item all.se - Causal standard errors for each w value.
  \item all.probs - Posterior inclusion probabilities per genetic variant for each w value.
  \item all.w - All w values used as part of the grid search.
}
}
\description{
This function implements the JAM-MR algorithm for Mendelian randomization.
Given a set of genetic variants and corresponding summary statistics for
associations with a risk factor and a disease outcome of interest, JAM-MR
performs Bayesian stochastic search through a reversible-jump MCMC algorithm 
to identify the most suitable variants for inclusion in a subsequent Mendelian
randomization analysis. The algorithm prioritizes genetic variants with strong 
associations with the risk factor while downweighting variants with heterogeneous 
ratio estimates through the use of the general Bayesian framework and a heterogeneity-
penalizing loss function. The stochastic search returns a list of models with 
associated posterior probabilties. For each of them, JAM-MR obtains a model-specific
causal effect estimate by fitting a normal or (if mretn = TRUE) a truncated normal
multiplictive random-effects model. Finally, the algorithm averages across the 
model-specific estimates to return an aggregate causal effect estimate and its 
standard error.
