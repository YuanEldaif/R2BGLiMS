\arguments{
\item{marginal.betas}{Vector of (named) marginal effect estimates to re-analyse with JAM under multivariate models. 
For multi-ethnic "mJAM" please provide a list of vectors, each element of which is a vector of marginal effects
for a specific ethnicity over the same variants.}

\item{n}{The size of the dataset in which the summary statistics (marginal.betas) were calculated}

\item{ns.each.ethnicity}{For mJAM: A vector of the sizes of each ethnicity dataset in which the summary statistics were calculated.}

\item{X.ref}{Reference genotype matrix used by JAM to impute the SNP-SNP correlations. If multiple regions are to be 
analysed this should be a list containing reference genotype matrices for each region. Individual's genotype
must be coded as a numeric risk allele count 0/1/2. Non-integer values reflecting imputation may be given.
NB: The risk allele coding MUST correspond to that used in marginal.betas. These matrices must each be positive definite and
the column names must correspond to the names of the marginal.betas vector.}

\item{model.space.priors}{Must be specified if model.selection is set to TRUE.
Two options are available. 1) A fixed prior is placed on the proportion of causal 
covariates, and all models with the same number of covariates is equally likely. This
is effectively a Poisson prior over the different possible model sizes. A list must
be supplied for `model.space.priors` with an element "Rate", specifying the prior 
proportion of causal covariates, and an element "Variables" containing the list of covariates
included in the model search. 2) The prior proportion of causal covariates
is treated as unknown and given a Beta(a, b) hyper-prior, in which case 
elements "a" and "b" must be included in the `model.space.priors` list rather
than "Rate". Higher values of "b" relative to "a" will encourage sparsity.
NOTE: It is easy to specify different model space priors for different collections of
covariates by providing a list of lists, each element of which is itself a model.space.prior
list asm described above for a particular subset of the covariates.}

\item{beta.priors}{There are three options: 
1) Leave as null, in which case N(0, 1e6) priors are placed on the effects
of confounders and any predictors included in model selection are assigned a
common normal prior with unknown variance.
2) Provide fixed priors for the confounders only. 
3) Provide fixed priors for all covariates. 
beta.priors (a matrix/data.frame) can be used to provide fixed priors; rows must be named with the corresponding 
variable names in the data, and include Guassian prior means and sds in the first and 
second columns respectively.}

\item{beta.prior.partitions}{By default, covariates without informative priors are 
ascribed a common Gaussian prior with a Unif(0.05,2) hyper-prior on the effect 
standard deviation. beta.prior.partitions can be used to partition the covariates 
into different prior groups, within each of which exchangeability can be assumed 
and a common prior with an independently estimated variance is used. 
beta.prior.partitions must be a list with as many elements as desired 
partitions. Each element must in turn be a list containing the following named 
elements: "Variables" - a list of covariates to be included in this partition, 
and "UniformA" and "UniformB" the Uniform hyper parameters. I.e., for a particular
partition, for v in "Variables", 
beta[v] | sigma_beta ~ N(0, sigma_beta^2) and 
sigma_beta ~ Unif("UniformA", "UniformB").}

\item{g.prior}{Whether to use a g-prior for the beta's, i.e. a multivariate normal 
with correlation structure proportional to sigma^2*X'X^-1, which is thought to aid
variable selection in the presence of strong correlation. By default this is enabled.}

\item{tau}{Value to use for sparsity parameter tau (under the tau*sigma^2 parameterisation).
When using the g-prior, a recommended default is max(n, P^2) where n is the number of individuals, and P is the number of predictors.}

\item{xtx.ridge.term}{Value to add to the constant of the diagonal of X'X before JAM takes the Cholesky decomposition.}

\item{enumerate.up.to.dim}{Whether to make posterior inference by exhaustively calculating
the posterior support for every possible model up to this dimension. Leaving at 0 to disable
and use RJMCMC instead. The current maximum allowed value is 5.}

\item{full.mcmc.sampling}{By default JAM only samples models, since the parameters can be analytically integrated out.
If you would like to force JAM to perform full Reversible Jump MCMC of models and parameters (effects and residual), then
set this to TRUE. The posterior summaries can be seen using \code{\link{PrettyResultsTable}}. Note that this option is
forced to false if inference via model enumeration is requested by setting enumerate.up.to.dim>0.}

\item{n.iter}{Number of iterations to run (default is 1e6)}

\item{n.mil.iter}{Number of million iterations to run. Can optionally be used instead of n.iter for convenience, which it will overide if specified.}

\item{thinning.interval}{Every nth iteration to store (i.e. for the Java algorithm to write to a file and then read into R). By default this is the
number of iterations divided by 1e4 (so for 1 million iterations every 100th is stored.) Higher values (so smaller posterior sample) can lead to 
faster runtimes for large numbers of covariates.}

\item{seed}{Which random number seed to use in the RJMCMC sampler. If none is provided, a random seed is picked between 1 and 2^16.}

\item{extra.arguments}{A named list of any additional arguments for BGLiMS. Type "data(DefaultArguments)" and look in the 
"default.arguments" list to see the names (which must match) and default values of available extra arguments. Currently these 
are not documented - please contact the package author, Paul Newcombe for details.}

\item{initial.model}{Optionally, an initial model can be provided as a vector of 0's and 1's. Default is NULL
and the null model is used. If set to 1, the saturated model is used.}

\item{save.path}{Optional path to save BGLiMS's data and results files. These are usually written as temporary files, and deleted
after running R2BGLiMS. However, this option might help for debugging.}

\item{max.model.dim}{Optional specification of maximum model dimension (default -1 means no maximum is set).}

\item{burnin.fraction}{Initial fraction of the iterations to throw away, e.g. setting to 0 would mean no burn-in. The 
default of 0.5 corresponds to the first half of iterations being discarded.}

\item{trait.variance}{NB EXPERIMENTAL: Invokes a slightly different summary statistic likelihood, which requires an estimate of
the trait variance to be provided. (Not yet implemented to work with mJAM or enumeration)}

\item{mrloss.w}{The relative weight of the MR log loss function for pleiotropy vs the log likelihood. Default 0.}

\item{mrloss.function}{Choice of pleiotropic loss function from "steve", "variance" (default variance)}

\item{mrloss.marginal.by}{Marginal associations between SNPs and outcome for the MR loss function model.}

\item{mrloss.marginal.sy}{Standard errors of marginal associations between SNPs and outcome for the MR loss function model 
(not required for mrloss.function "variance")}

\item{mafs.if.independent}{If the SNPs are independent then a reference genotype matrix is not required.
However, it is still necessary to provide SNP MAFs here as a named vector. Doing so will lead to X.ref being 
ignored and the SNPs to be modelled as if they are independent. Note that this option does not work with 
enumeration.}

\item{extra.java.arguments}{A character string to be passed through to the java command line. E.g. to specify a
different temporary directory by passing "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/Temp".}
}
\value{
An R2BGLiMS_Results class object is returned. See the slot 'posterior.summary.table' for a posterior summary of all parameters. 
See slot 'mcmc.output' for a matrix containing the raw MCMC output from the saved posterior samples (0 indicates a covariate is excluded 
from the model in a particular sample. Some functions for summarising results are listed under "see also".
